# 6)  Write a Python program to find numbers divisible by nineteen or thirteen from a list of numbers using Lambda
# Orginal list: [19, 65, 57, 39, 152, 639, 121, 44, 90, 190]
# Numbers of the above list divisible by nineteen or thirteen: [19, 65, 57, 39, 152, 190]

numbers =  [19, 65, 57, 39, 152, 639, 121, 44, 90, 190]

result = list(filter(lambda x: x % 19 == 0 or x % 13 ==0,numbers))

print('numbers list that is divisible by nineteen or thirteen: ',result)
